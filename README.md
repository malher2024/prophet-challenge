 ## Forecasting Net Prophet

 This application analyzes the growth analyst at MercadoLibre. With over 200 million users, MercadoLibre is the most popular e-commerce site in Latin America. You've been tasked with analyzing the company's financial and user data in clever ways to make the company grow. So, you want to find out if the ability to predict search traffic can translate into the ability to successfully trade the stock.

The instructions for this Challenge are divided into four steps, as follows:

Step 1: Find unusual patterns in hourly Google search traffic

The data science manager asks if the Google search traffic for the company links to any financial events at the company. Or, does the search traffic data just present random noise? To answer this question, pick out any unusual patterns in the Google search data for the company, and connect them to the corporate financial events.

Step 2: Mine the search traffic data for seasonality

Marketing realizes that they can use the hourly search data, too. If they can track and predict interest in the company and its platform for any time of day, they can focus their marketing efforts around the times that have the most traffic. This will get a greater return on investment (ROI) from their marketing budget.

Step 3: Relate the search traffic to stock price patterns

You mention your work on the search traffic data during a meeting with people in the finance group at the company. They want to know if any relationship between the search data and the company stock price exists, and they ask if you can investigate.

Step 4: Create a time series model with Prophet

Now, you need to produce a time series model that analyzes and forecasts patterns in the hourly search data
